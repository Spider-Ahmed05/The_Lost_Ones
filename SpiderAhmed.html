                    <p>My name is Ahmed safy aldean Hafiz, 08/10/2023 at this date I'm 18 years old, I'm a guy who's obsessed with technolgy..
                        In my career I learned, Game Development & Web Development specifically the front-end, And a little bit of animations both dimensional 2D, 3D, The programming languages I learned are, 
                    c, c#, JavaScript.. add to them HTML & CSS even if they aren't programming languages, HTML is a mark up language, CSS is a style sheet language,
                For animating I used Blender for 3D, And moho for 2D, But I really didn't like animtion world as I did with gameDev and webDev.</p>

                    <p>Unity I can say is the best thing ever happened to me, I had a cool trip with it.. Basically unity is a game Engin, used to create both 2D & 3D games,
                        throw unity I learnd my first programming language which is c#, and I had a lot  of useful knowledge at math or even at physics, I made alot of games but,
                        I just published a few of them, Why?... Basically becuase I wanted my games to be perfect even at the beginning but, Eventually I realised that it doesn't have to be,
                        so I published a few of them lately.

                    <p>Blender is the first software I tried to learn, I wanted to know how 3D animations are made and, When I searched I found that there is a lot of steps to creat them,
                        First Of all creating the main idea, then creating 3D models, then using what the software gives you, You try to make that animation in your mind..
                     it might seem simple But, trust me it's not, Also I might not mention some steps, beacuse, I didn't really continue in blender, because I found it hard, and at that time,
                    I wasn't that free, so I stopped.</p>

                    <p>Moho is a 2D animation software, And to be honest I didn't had a long trip with moho, it was just like a fun trip I guess, it was nice but,
                        I didn't like 2D animating at all, fun fact, Even though I didn't like 2D animating, I enjoy Developing 2D games in unity, I find it more fun than 3D.
